# Episodes - Meso-Level Perspective

[__Episodes__](https://github.com/mehimself/onlineCourses_content/blob/master/episodes/README.md) treat topics in more depth. They narrow down the focus in the course onto sub-topics. They break down learnable content into four didactic representations: [__material__](https://github.com/mehimself/onlineCourses_content/blob/master/material/README.md), [__example__](https://github.com/mehimself/onlineCourses_content/blob/master/examples/README.md), [__summary__](https://github.com/mehimself/onlineCourses_content/blob/master/summaries/README.md), and [__point__](https://github.com/mehimself/onlineCourses_content/blob/master/points/README.md).
